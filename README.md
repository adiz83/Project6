This research explores the application of BERT in enhancing semantic search through advanced tag generation. Traditional keyword-based search systems often fail to capture the nuanced meaning and context of user queries, leading to less relevant results. By leveraging BERT's deep learning capabilities, this study aims to improve the accuracy and relevance of information retrieval. Our methodology includes training a Named Entity Recognition (NER) model to identify and categorize entities within search queries, which are then used for BERT-based tag generation. This approach also involves multi-tag analysis to enhance the precision and relevance of search results by considering intersections and relationships between tagged entities. The significance of this research lies in its potential to address challenges like ambiguity and context sensitivity in natural language queries, thereby advancing the field of semantic search and information retrieval.
